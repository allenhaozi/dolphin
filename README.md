## Base LLM
Base LLM has been trained to predict the next word base on text training data.     
often trained on a large amount of data from the internet and other sources     
to figure out what's the next most likely word to follow 

## Instruction Tuned LLM
has been trained to follow instructions    
the way that instruction tune LLMs are typically trained is
You start off with a base LLMs that has been trained on a huge amount of text data and further train it further fine tune it    
with input and outputs that are instructions and good attempts to follow     
and then often further refine using a technique call RLHF reinforcement learning from human feedback    
to make the system better able to be helpful and follow instructions      
because instruction tuned LLMs have been trained to be helpful honest and harmless      

     
a lot of the practical usage scenarios have been shifting to all the instructions tuned LLMs     


we would recommend most people instead focus on instruction tuned LLMs which are easy to use      

and also because of the work of open AI and other LLM companies becoming safer and more aligned
